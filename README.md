## Configuration

The application uses several configurable parameters:

- **Plot Size**: 500 - 3000 sq ft
- **Plot Price**: ‚Çπ1,000 - ‚Çπ5,000 per sq ft
- **Construction Area**: 800 - 2,500 sq ft
- **Construction Price**: ‚Çπ1,200 - ‚Çπ3,000 per sq ft
- **Down Payment**: 10% - 50%
- **Interest Rate**: 7% - 12%
- **Loan Tenure**: 5 - 30 years

## Features in Detail

### Combined Loan Approach
Unlike traditional calculators that treat plot and construction as separate loans, this application calculates a single combined loan that includes:
- Plot acquisition cost
- Construction cost (if applicable)
- Single EMI for the entire project
- Unified down payment calculation

### FOIR Analysis
The application provides comprehensive FOIR (Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio) analysis:
- Current FOIR calculation
- Projected FOIR after investment
- Risk level assessment
- Recommendations based on financial capacity

### Interactive Configuration
- Real-time slider controls for all parameters
- Instant calculation updates
- Visual feedback for risk levels
- Comprehensive metric display
